Compute Ix and Iy correctly by finite differences.
Construct images of Ix2, Iy2 and IxIy correctly.
Compute a proper filter size for a Gaussian filter based on its sigma value.
Construct a proper 1D Gaussian filter.
Smooth a 2D image by convolving it with two 1D Gaussian filters.
Handle the image border using partial filters in smoothing.
Construct an image of the cornerness function R correctly
Identify potential corners at local maxima in the image of the cornerness function R.
Compute the cornerness value and coordinates of the potential corners up to sub-pixel accuract by quadratic approximation.
Use the threshold value to identify strong corners for output.
